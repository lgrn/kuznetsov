# this script creates a 'forward' on the lxd host and imports defined port-forwards.

# IMPORTANT NOTES
# - this uses 'ext_ip' set on the LXD host (file: 'hosts')

# create the initial forward, listening on 'ext_ip'
# this will fail if it already exists, that's fine

lxc network forward create lxdbr0 {{ ext_ip }}

# import forward.yml as authoritative port forwarding definition
lxc network forward edit lxdbr0 {{ ext_ip }} < /tmp/forward.yml

# to show current runtime configuration, run:
# lxc network forward show lxdbr0
